# Face-Recognition-PCA
PCA based face recognition using Eigenfaces and implemented through MATLAB. Using a databse of face images and projection into face-space a face-recognition and identification algorithm is implemented in this repo.

## Usage Instructions

1. Run the file CreateDatabase.m in MATLAB to create a dump file for the images in the image folders.
2. Running **Recognition.m** will do the needful - the final output is the amount of similarity in the faces in the TEST and TRAIN folders.

You can try replacing the images in the TEST and TRAIn folders with images of your own. This should be wokring equally fine. Let me know in case there are issues.
